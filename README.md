# eeg_preprocessing_pipeline
This pipeline was created as part of a 7.5 ECTS research project during the MSc in Software Design program at the IT University of Copenhagen. It is an EEG data preprocessing tool designed to support newcomers in preprocessing of EEG data. The pipeline outputs a cleaned EEG file in .fif format along with a detailed report.
